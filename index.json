[{"categories":null,"contents":"The Power of Preparedness: Why a UPS is a Lifesaver for Home Servers Lessons from a Power Outage Misadventure\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve all heard the saying, \u0026ldquo;With great power comes great responsibility.\u0026quot; But what about, \u0026ldquo;With great server hosting comes great problems\u0026rdquo;? As home server enthusiasts, we embark on a journey filled with excitement and challenges, seeking the thrill of managing our own services. However, yesterday\u0026rsquo;s power outage served as a poignant reminder that hosting our own services also means hosting our own problems. Enter the unsung hero of the day: the Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).\nPower Outages: The Uninvited Guests Imagine this: you\u0026rsquo;ve invested your time and effort into setting up a home server, meticulously configuring each aspect to cater to your needs. Your website, file server, or perhaps a game server is running like a well-oiled machine. Then, out of nowhere, the lights flicker and darkness envelops your once-bustling server room. Power outage â€“ the uninvited guest that can wreak havoc on your digital oasis.\nThe Dreaded Aftermath Yesterday, I found myself in this exact situation. A sudden power outage brought my carefully crafted server setup crashing down. When the power finally returned, so did the dread. My server booted up, but something was off. The boot options were corrupted, and chaos reigned. It was as if my server\u0026rsquo;s operating system was suffering from a bad hangover â€“ sluggish, confused, and anything but functional.\nThe Grub Woes and Fstab Fiasco After some investigation, I realized that the power interruption had jolted the system in ways I hadn\u0026rsquo;t anticipated. The boot options were tangled up, and the grub configuration had gone awry. To make matters worse, the /etc/fstab file, responsible for mounting file systems at boot, was playing hard to get. It was a classic case of \u0026ldquo;when you host your own services, you host your own problems.\u0026quot;\nEnter the Hero: Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) In this dire situation, the UPS came to the rescue â€“ the unsung hero that saved the day. An Uninterruptible Power Supply is like a digital knight in shining armor. It stands between your server and the unpredictable nature of electricity supply. When a power outage strikes, the UPS seamlessly takes over, offering a few precious minutes to gracefully shut down your server rather than yanking the power out abruptly.\nLessons Learned and Silver Linings As frustrating as the power outage experience was, it served as a valuable lesson. It underscored the importance of being prepared for the unexpected when running your own home server. A UPS might seem like an afterthought, but it can be the difference between a minor hiccup and a major catastrophe. While we might joke that \u0026ldquo;when you host your own services, you host your own problems,\u0026quot; it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to remember that we also have the power to mitigate those problems through thoughtful planning and the right tools.\nSo, fellow server enthusiasts, take it from someone who learned the hard way â€“ invest in a reliable UPS for your home server setup. You\u0026rsquo;ll be thanking yourself when the lights go out, and your server stays online, ready to face another day of hosting with resilience and grace.\n","date":"2023-08-22T07:56:47+03:00","permalink":"https://toukaktus.github.io/website/post/ups/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"The Power of Preparedness: Why a UPS is a Lifesaver for Home Servers"},{"categories":["gallery"],"contents":"","date":"2023-08-20T05:06:24+03:00","permalink":"https://toukaktus.github.io/website/gallery/hw_pics/","section":"gallery","tags":null,"title":"Hardware"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hey there!

It champions declarative configuration, ensuring atomic upgrades, and employs content-addressable package management for unparalleled reproducibility and system integrity.\nDeclarative Configuration for Unbreakable Systems At the core of NixOS lies the concept of declarative system configuration. This paradigm shift empowers users to define their system\u0026rsquo;s desired state using a single configuration file. This file encapsulates everything from software packages to network settings, all expressed in a functional language. This approach guarantees that changes are reversible, transparent, and free from interference with the current system state. This design fosters system resilience, enabling rapid recovery from issues and uniform behavior across various installations.\nReproducibility and Atomic Upgrades NixOS tackles the perennial issue of dependency conflicts during upgrades with its content-addressable package management system. Each package and its dependencies are meticulously identified using cryptographic hashes, allowing different package versions to coexist harmoniously. This meticulous approach enhances system reproducibility, ensuring that a precise system configuration can be faithfully recreated on multiple machines.\nconfiguration.nix and Generations: A Powerful Duo Central to NixOS\u0026rsquo;s configuration management is the configuration.nix file. This file serves as the repository of the entire system\u0026rsquo;s configuration, encompassing software installations, kernel parameters, and beyond. By editing this file, users articulate their desired system state. NixOS employs a historical record of configurations via \u0026ldquo;generations.\u0026rdquo; Each configuration change results in a new generation, enabling effortless rollback to prior states, thus maintaining a dependable and unbreakable system environment.\nExample of configuration.nix:\n# /etc/nixos/configuration.nix { config, pkgs, ... }: { imports = [ ./hardware-configuration.nix ]; networking.hostName = \u0026quot;my-nixos-machine\u0026quot;; time.timeZone = \u0026quot;UTC\u0026quot;; environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ neovim firefox htop ]; users.users = { myuser = { isNormalUser = true; uid = 1000; home = \u0026quot;/home/myuser\u0026quot;; }; }; } Nix Flakes: Enhancing Development and Deployment Nix Flakes, an extension of NixOS, introduces a structured way to define package sets, configurations, and environments. This advancement simplifies sharing and replicating setups across different projects and systems. Nix Flakes solidifies reproducibility further and streamlines development and deployment workflows.\nResources for Exploring NixOS Official NixOS Website: Access comprehensive documentation, installation guides, and the latest news.\nNixpkgs Repository: Dive into the collection of package definitions for NixOS, spanning various software and libraries.\nNixOS Wiki: Explore user-contributed tutorials, documentation, and tips catering to diverse use cases.\nNixOS Discourse Forum: Engage in community discussions, seek support, and share knowledge.\nIn a landscape marked by innovation and transformation, NixOS takes a bold stance, offering stability, predictability, and a novel approach to system management. Its revolutionary methods challenge norms, promising a glimpse into the future of Linux distributions. By embracing NixOS, users venture into uncharted territory, where system reproducibility and resilience reign supreme.\n","date":"2023-08-20T00:51:04+03:00","permalink":"https://toukaktus.github.io/website/post/nixos/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"NixOS: Revolutionizing Linux through Reproducibility and Unbreakable Configuration"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I\u0026rsquo;m Abdulrahman Alomairah, a passionate software engineer with a strong interest in open-source projects and cybersecurity.

Yes! This was my main motivation for this code. Furthermore, sometimes Iphone users are unable to play uncommon? extensions like .webm,.mkv,.mov,.wav.
